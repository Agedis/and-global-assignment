# Task 1
1. Get a High-Level Overview
Find online beginner-friendly resources and read articles to understand the why behind ERNIE.

2. Explore Live Demos
Try out a hosted ERNIE demo on Hugging Face Spaces or other online examples.
Test simple tasks like masked word filling, sentiment analysis, or question answering.

3. Run prebuilt code 
Load a pretrained ERNIE model and run it on sample inputs for testing. 
4. Understand Knowledge Masking 
Study the key innovation: ERNIE masks entire concepts or entities rather than single words.
Use simple examples to internalize the difference from BERT.

5. Experiment with Mini Tasks 
Fine-tune ERNIE on a small dataset for a practical task, like sentiment analysis. Observe features such as outputs, tokenization behavior, and model predictions.
# Task 2

# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction  

This project trains and deploys a machine learning model that predicts an individual‚Äôs medical insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle features.  

---

## üìä Dataset  
The model was trained on the [Medical Insurance Cost Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mosapabdelghany/medical-insurance-cost-dataset) from Kaggle.  

**Features include:**  
- `age` (numeric)  
- `sex` (binary: 0 = female, 1 = male)  
- `bmi` (numeric)  
- `children` (numeric)  
- `smoker` (binary: 0 = non-smoker, 1 = smoker)  
- `region` (one-hot encoded: northwest, southeast, southwest, northeast [baseline])  

---

## ü§ñ Model  
A **linear regression model** was chosen for its interpretability and suitability for continuous outcomes.  
We compared:  
- Ordinary Linear Regression  
- Regularized models: **Ridge**, and **ElasticNet**  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R¬≤ Score (on training and test sets)  

üìå Regularization did not significantly improve performance, so **ordinary linear regression** was selected as the final model.  

The code used for training the linear regression model is available in a **Google Colab notebook**:  
[Open Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1z4wuowh5jqf758zdt85syZEAoCn0hJdm#scrollTo=bn2DRnsoPTw4)

This notebook includes:  
- Preliminary analysis of the dataset
- Data preprocessing steps (handling categorical variables, scaling numeric features)  
- Model training (ordinary linear regression and comparisons with regularized models)  
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, R¬≤)  
- Visualization of results 
---

## üöÄ Deployment  
The trained model is deployed using a simple **Flask** web server.  

- Accepts **JSON input** with feature values  
- Returns predicted insurance cost as **JSON output**  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation  

Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-cost-prediction.git
cd insurance-cost-prediction

python app.py (the server will start locally by default assuming all the necessary packages are installed)
```

## Example JSON request
{
  "age": 19,
  "sex": 1,
  "bmi": 140,
  "children": 0,
  "smoker": 0,
  "region_northwest": 0,
  "region_southeast": 0,
  "region_southwest": 1
}

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Input Preconditions  

When sending JSON input to the API, please ensure the following:  

- **Age**: Must be a positive integer (e.g., `19`).  
- **Sex**: Encoded as `0` (female) or `1` (male).  
- **BMI**: Must be a positive float or integer (e.g., `27.9`).  
- **Children**: Non-negative integer (e.g., `0`, `1`, `2`, ‚Ä¶).  
- **Smoker**: Encoded as `0` (non-smoker) or `1` (smoker).  
- **Region**: Represented with one-hot encoding:  
  - `region_northwest`, `region_southeast`, `region_southwest`  
  - Each takes a value of `0` or `1`.  
  - **Exactly one** region should be `1`, and the others must be `0`.  
  - Example: `"region_southwest": 1, "region_southeast": 0, "region_northwest": 0`  

If these conditions are not met, the model‚Äôs predictions may be unreliable or the server may throw an error.  

## Example output
{
  "predicted_insurance_cost": 45231.78
}
